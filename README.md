# Euler-projects

In this repo, I post my attempts to solve some of the coding challenges in the Euler project website.

Here is a link to the website [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/).

The files are named p_x where x is the number of the problem as it figures in the website.

I use python for this pertucular project.
